# PSC in the Enterprise Context

## Assumption
It is a cool thing if people can solve the tasks they like and delegate the rest.

## History
### Peer 2 Peer Enterprise  
For income tax related unnecessary overhead we decided to use an Enterprise Internal Coin (EIC). The value of it comes from being able to delegate / fund tasks which you do not like to solve by your own.

## Plan
Additionally to the Peer 2 Peer Enterprise mechanism we would like to introduce project specific enterprise-internal profit sharing tokens which could be traded to 
company wide EIC. As EIC can not be traded / swaped to Fiat currency we guess we are save from income taxes or other penalties for creating value. 

EIC are rather meant to generate freedom, happiness and company-wide higher quality of software solutions as anyone can solve the tasks he likes and delegate the rest. 

In this sense we could also call Profit SHaring Tokens (PST) - Freedom Sharing Tokens (FSTs) in the enterprise context.

What AR is in the Open Source World - is EIC in the Enterprise World.
What Verto is in the Open Source World - Verto Enterprise is in the Enterprise World.
What GitCoin is in the Open Source World - Peer 2 Peer Enterprise is in the Inner Source World.


## How we - Enterprise Folks - want to support Nest.land + Arweave
We will facilitate regular TGIF Hackathons in several Enterprises which give enterprise people the chance to freely contribute to Open Source Projects / Modules.
A growing number of managers seems to understand that this is time well invested to support mutual education among "their workforce" and also to attract young talents as potential employees.
