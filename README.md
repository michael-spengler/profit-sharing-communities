# PSC in the Enterprise Context

## Assumption
It is a cool thing if people can solve the tasks they like and delegate the rest.

## History
### Peer 2 Peer Enterprise  
For Income Tax related unnecessary overhead we decided to use an Enterprise Internal Coin (EIC). The value of it comes from being able to delegate / fund tasks which you do not like to solve by your own.

## Plan
Additionally to the Peer 2 Peer Enterprise mechanism we would like to introduce project specific enterprise-internal profit sharing tokens which could be traded to 
company specific EIC. As EIC can not be traded / swaped to Fiat currency we guess we are save from income taxes or other penalties for creating value. 

In this sense we could also call PSTs Freedom Sharing Tokens (FSTs) in the enterprise context.

What AR is in the Open Source World - is EIC in the Enterprise World.
What Verto is in the Open Source World - Verto Enterprise is in the Enterprise World.
What GitCoin is in the Open Source World - Peer 2 Peer Enterprise is in the Inner Source World.


## How we - Enterprise Folks - want to support Nest.land + Arweave
We will facilitate regular TGIF Hackathons in several Enterprises which give enterprise people the chance to freely contribute to Open Source Projects / Modules.
A growing number of managers seems to understand that this is time well invested to support mutual education among "their workforce" and also to attract young talents as potential employees.
